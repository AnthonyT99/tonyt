For aslong as I remember I've always been using software, back to when I was young and started playing video games on a ps2 someone had to develep the software used on the consoles and games, and as I've grown older I've realized that I've been a user of these softwares for all these years, now after coming to that realization I don't want to just be a user I want to be a developer as well, so thats why I started my coding journey.
